# Brainhacker's Guide to Smoke Cessation

## TL;DR

* Addiction is mostly habitual/associative in nature; more so than chemical.
* There are many more active ingredients in tobacco than just nicotine - nicotine replacement products (patches, gum, e-cigs) leave us craving.
* Deprivation is frustrating and stressful, making cheating and going for that one cigarette in times of need attractive.
* Avoiding the situations that we associate with smoking is not long-term viable; eventually you will get into those situations again.
* **We need to break down the body's association between the act of smoking and the satisfaction of our tobacco cravings.**
* _Replacing a smoking habit with nicotine replacement products does not accomplish this._
* By **slowly** substituting tobacco with non-tobacco in our cigarettes, we make our body "unlearn" the association between smoking and fulfilling the crave.

## Benefits

* Cheap
* Easy
* No stress
* No need to suppress urges
* No residual urges

## Rationale

First of all, I have used this method in the past and successfully quit smoking with surprising ease. I kept it up for over half a year _without any cravings or needing to suppress any urges_. I eventually did start smoking again when I was having self-destructive tendencies, but I don't think any method of stopping smoking could have prevented that.

I have also tried nicotine replacement products; specifically, I have vaped/used an e-cig for quite some time, but honestly it did not satisfy my cravings for a cigarette. Drinking caffeinated soda does not satisfy a craving for good espresso. Before I came up with this method I tried simply smoking less, but whenever I was in a situation that I strongly associated with smoking (drinking beer with friends, for example), the cravings would weigh on me heavily and I would give in and smoke more than "budgeted". _After using this method, even being out drinking with friends did not cause any cravings._

The clue here is that before this method, I had never actually broken down the associations between certain behaviours and the craving to smoke. The human brain is excellent at forming emotional associations; this is how we learn a lot of basic things. Unfortunately, it is not perfect, some things make us feel good in the short term but aren't great in the longer term. We are always told we need to practice discipline and learn to control our urges, but if _we can hack our brain and break down our urges_ this results in much better results.

The idea behind this method is to indulge in the habits that we use to satisfy our cravings, while eroding the association between the indulgence and the satisfaction. 

## Method

In practical terms, we replace the tobacco in our cigarettes with something else. If we transition into this replacement slowly enough, the experience will be similar enough that our body thinks we are smoking a cigarette. If we transition too fast, we risk having a strongly noticeable difference and start craving a "real" cigarette.

### Requirements

* Tobacco replacement. This is probably the most crucial choice - you want something that is pleasant to smoke and with a good texture; especially when rolling manually. A good texture means that it should be easy to compress, it should feel "springy" between your fingers. Avoid products that have a lot of "hard" components like sticks or needles. Knaster is a poor choice for this reason. I personally hate the taste of Greengo, another popular offering in this market. My best experience has been with "marshmallow leaf", an inexpensive product that has excellent texture and a somewhat boring but not offputting taste.
* Rolling tobacco. Pick any brand you enjoy.
* A scale to measure the ratios. Get one that can measure 0.1g increments or smaller.
* Depending on your preferences:
    * Empty cigarette shells and a cigarette maker machine - good option if you are used to smoking premade cigarettes. Your local tobacco specialty store will have these, they are quite inexpensive (mine cost slightly more than 2 packs of cigarettes for the machine and 10 packs worth of shells).
    * Rolling papers and filters - if you're already used to rolling your own cigarettes, you will already have these. If you have the skills to roll manually and would prefer that over using a machine, but are in the habit of smoking premade store cigarettes, it would be a good idea to take a week to get used to rolling again before starting the transition. It's best if the starting point of the transition is as close to your regular habit as possible.

### Strategy

Over the course of several weeks we will slowly transition from smoking 100% tobacco to smoking 0% tobacco. Aim to reach 0% **at least** one month away, maybe two. Going too fast will not help you; you want to give your body time to "learn" that cigarettes don't "do it" anymore. Do this in small steps, e.g. 5% or 10%. So, the first phase of the transition, you might smoke 90% tobacco 10% replacement (by weight), after that 80/20, etc. If you're rolling manually, make your mix and put it in an empty rolling tobacco pouch, or use a ziploc bag. If you're premaking them with the machine, make your mix and create a batch of cigarettes.

The first time I followed this method, I stopped smoking in 2 weeks. When I reached the 50/50 ratio mark, I just flat out lost all of my urge/appetite for smoking, so I stopped doing it. I still went for my regular "smoke breaks" but simply did not smoke. This is why I am recommending aiming to reach 0% in a month, maybe two, because you will probably stop smoking long before that.

Advice for premade: it takes about 1g of mix for a cigarette, but you'll want to experiment with this. Make a cigarette, then feel the sides to see if it's packed as tightly as a regular storebought cigarette. You don't want them to feel loose or underfilled - it will cause uneven burning and an unsatisfying smoke.

**Seek out** the situations where you usually smoke. You will know what they are. For me, I tend to smoke when walking to/from the supermarket, occasionally throughout the workday on a cigarette break, and when out drinking. **Make time** to engage in these activities during your transition - you want to break down the association between the satisfaction of smoking and engaging in these activities.
